  shorttitle = {Sectoral Linking of Carbon Markets},
  abstract = {The linking of emission trading systems (ETS) is a widely discussed policy option for future international cooperation on climate change. Benefits are expected from efficiency gains and the alleviation of concerns over competitiveness. However, from trade-theory it is known that due to general equilibrium effects and market distortions, linking may not always be beneficial for all participating countries. Following-up on this debate, we use a Ricardo-Viner type general equilibrium model to study the implications of sectoral linking on carbon emissions (`leakage'), competitiveness, and welfare. By comparing pre- and post-linking equilibria, we show analytically how global emissions can increase if one of the `linked' countries lacks an economy-wide emissions cap, although in case of a link across idiosyncratic sectors a decrease of emissions (`anti-leakage') is also possible. If \textendash{} as a way to address concerns about competitiveness \textendash{} a link between the EU ETS and a hypothetical US system is established, the partial emission coverage of the EU ETS can lead to the creation of new distortions between the non-covered domestic and international sector. Finally, we show how the welfare effect from linking can be decomposed into gains-from-trade and terms-of-trade contributions, and how the latter can make the overall effect ambiguous.},

  title = {Environmental Assessment of Solar Thermal Systems for the Industrial Sector},
  volume = {176},
  issn = {0959-6526},
  abstract = {In Europe, about a third of the total final energy demand of the industrial sector is used for the generation of low temperature heat below 100 \textdegree{}C which could be satisfied by commercially available solar thermal applications. Although the technological readiness level of solar thermal technologies is currently in high levels, the recent energy mix data of industrial countries with high solar irradiation levels reveal that this potential still remains untapped. The key objective of this work is to quantify this unexploited potential and assess the environmental impact of industrial solar thermal systems (ISTS). Under this context, cradle-to-use Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted for the definition of the environmental performance of ISTS. A parametric analysis for the application of ISTS at selected European sites with diverse solar potential was also implemented to investigate the impact of solar potential on the life cycle performance of the systems. Taking into consideration the findings on the potential of carbon savings from the application of ISTS and in relevance to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), scenarios of ISTS penetration and monetization into the industrial sector have also been developed. The findings of this work can be used by policy-makers as guidelines for the development of national strategic plans and financial incentives for the promotion of large-scale industrial solar thermal applications. The implementation of a parametric assessment on the environmental performance of ISTS for specific European geographical locations of diverse solar potential enabled the development of a `Life Cycle Produced to Consumed Energy' Ratio, which indicated that applications located at lower latitudes (in the northern hemisphere) can achieve greater life cycle energy and carbon savings than ISTS applications found higher in latitude. In particular, large-scale ISTS applications were found to achieve energy and carbon savings ranging from 35 to 75 GJ and 2\textendash{}5 tonnes of CO2 per kWth, depending on the geographical location.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze the effect that the Energy Tax Directive reform proposed in 2011 would have, if implemented, on the level of prices in the different sectors of the 27 countries of the European Union. We apply a multiregional and multisectoral model of trade flows that takes into account all the intersectoral and intercountry interdependences in the production processes. Using the World Input\textendash{}Output Database we perform two different simulations. The first one considers the tax changes proposed by the reform; the second one shows the impact the reform would have entailed if it were applied also to sectors belonging to the European Trade System. The main finding of the first simulation shows that the new energy tax regime would have had a low economic cost in terms of impact on prices (less than 1\% in all the countries). So, the concerns about competitiveness do not find empirical support in our results, suggesting the need for further analyses to find out the reasons that caused the failure of a reform that was an important step to introduce a taxation explicitly linked to CO2 emissions. The second simulation, however, leads to strongly different results, pointing out the relevance of maintaining significant economic incentives to reduce carbon emissions for the European Trade System sectors, by improving the emission market performance or by applying carbon taxation also to these sectors.},

  abstract = {Carbon pricing is an essential instrument to address climate change. However international differences in carbon control policies may cause not only carbon leakage but also competitiveness disadvantages. In this context, border carbon adjustments are a promising tool for discouraging these problems. But designing a real-world border carbon adjustment instrument implies to consider significant issues: technical feasibility, data availability, the risk of retaliation from developing countries, and its compatibility within the World Trade Organization legal framework. There are still no conclusive answers about a proper design. This paper is an attempt to address the above-mentioned challenges proposing a carbon border tax (CBT) based on avoided emissions. Such a CBT is applied at a product level and not at a sector level, and all international prices are deflated to guarantee that import `like' goods received a treatment similar to `like' domestic products. Using the WIOD, we simulate a CBT based on avoided emissions applied by the European Union, and we compare the results with a CBT based on embodied emissions.},

Other factors, including rising primary energy prices and difficulties for primary smelters in obtaining long-term electricity-supply contracts, appear to have been more economically important factors than the relatively low CO2 costs which have been witnessed so far.},

I contrast previous ex-ante studies with the lessons from a series of interviews I conducted with industrials, and the public data available on the first phase of the scheme, effective from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007. I conclude that because of organizational inertia, weak incentives linked to the low emission permit price that prevailed during its second part, and important industrial and regulatory constraints, the Phase I of EU ETS has had a limited economic impact on firms. However, this first trading period was instrumental in allowing the rening sector to build the capabilities needed to respond efficiently to the carbon price signal in the long run. I argue that the internal and external constraints that this first phase revealed will shape the future outcome of the scheme. Based on evidence from the rening sector under EU ETS, I take position in the current debate over policy design to suggest ways for regulators to improve the economic impact and environmental effectiveness of carbon markets.},

Although a larger ETS will be more efficient, the literature warns that it could make net permit selling regions worse off. We use a CGE model to simulate the linking of two provincial ETSs, namely those of Hubei and Guangdong. Our simulations suggest a trade-off between efficiency and equity as the richer regions (typified by Guangdong) will benefit from linking but the poorer regions (typified by Hubei) may lose. This is because poorer provinces in China tend to be more emissions intensive and therefore likely to face a carbon price rise upon linking, the costs of which may be only partially offset by trading, if indeed trading is permitted. We show this, and explain why it is the case by improving on the stylized model suggested by Adams and Parmenter (2013). Following Atkinson (1970), we find that worsened equity from linking may dominate improved efficiency, thus reducing aggregated welfare. We advise more generous caps to be given to more emissions intensive and less developed regions. If so, as suggest our simulation results, a Pareto-improvement could be attainable.},

  abstract = {The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is important through its role as the ``cornerstone'' of EU climate change policy as well as a ``role mode'', and ``pioneer'' for carbon markets. It is important that, in addition to the regulatory requirements, it be subjected to a thorough and independent review, to discover if it delivers on explicit, and what have become ``expected'' objectives, as well as discover any issues that need to be better understood. Availability of public data has been identified as a barrier to some parts of this analysis.
The EU ETS can be seen as being expected to deliver in a number of different areas: environmental targets in different timeframes, decarbonization in an economically efficient way, including protection against the risk of carbon leakage, and good market functioning and price discovery.
The recently concluded review for Phase 4 (P4) has attempted to tackle a number of outstanding issues, and its new parameters and architecture will strongly influence the EU ETS' functioning from here on. Current price scenarios indicate rising prices during P4, but a lot of issues still remain open, up for implementation, or up for review, which could significantly influence these projections.
Other EU climate legislation in the pipeline, such as the governance of the Energy Union Regulation and the new EU long-term climate strategy, will include elements that will leave their mark on the EU ETS, its functioning and its ability to deliver, as well possibly require future reviews and revisions. A ``sentiment survey'' conducted as part of this report seems to indicate that stakeholders are unsure of the effectiveness of these changes, but recent price trends indicate a willingness to give it the benefit of the doubt.
Despite the fact that emissions increased in 2017 for the first time in 7 years, there is still little doubt that the EU ETS is delivering on its short-term environmental targets. However, the post-2020 Linear Reduction Factor (LRF) will not be sufficient to put the EU ETS on the pathway outlined in the `2050 Roadmap', and reaching the goal set out in the Paris Agreement will surely require additional efforts.
While the sectors under the EU ETS are decarbonizing, especially the power sector, it was only marginal in driving this process. A number of reasons, including the inclusion of international credits, the economic crisis, as well as policy overlaps, have led the market to be oversupplied, keeping EUA prices down.

The recent increase in CO2 prices might indicate that this will change in the future, and our analysis shows that prices of \texteuro{}10-30/ton could be sufficient to make low-emission alternatives compete with coal and gas during 2020-2030.
Monetary impacts have so far mostly been limited to combustion of fuels installations, while free allocations have covered costs for the industrial sector. However, it must be noted that, contrary to Phase 2 (P2), free allocation is much more in balance with actual emissions during Phase 3 (P3), halting the growth or even decreasing the cumulated surplus of allowances in most industrial sectors.
Carbon leakage risks from direct costs have so far seemed to be mitigated, but indirect costs are a continuous concern in terms of the provisions that apply to it. Since there is no harmonized approach, not all Member States have compensation schemes in place, meaning a potential distortion exists across Europe.
Our eight KPIs to evaluate the functioning of the market show the market functioned slightly better compared to last year: three out of the eight tracked KPIs exhibited an improvement, while only two KPIs showed a worsening performance. Despite that some critical points remain, we can state that the market is functioning well, and even showing signs of improvement.
To ensure that the EU ETS is `fit for purpose' and ready to face future challenges, we identified a number of issues that will need to be monitored in the coming years, including:
\textbullet{} Restore short-term scarcity through the Market Stability Reserve;
\textbullet{} Make the EU ETS resilient to policy interactions and to policy uncertainty;
\textbullet{} Make the EU ETS governance operational;
\textbullet{} Manage carbon leakage risk;
\textbullet{} Align the EU ETS with the long-term EU climate ambition, compatible with Paris Agreement
goals;
\textbullet{} Provide financial support for low-carbon competitiveness of EU industry and the transition towards a low-carbon economy.},

  abstract = {This article analyses the implementation of emissions trading systems (ETSs) in eight jurisdictions: the EU, Switzerland, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and California in the US, Qu{\'e}bec in Canada, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and pilot schemes in China. The article clarifies what is working, what isn't and why, when it comes to the practice of implementing an ETS. The eight ETSs are evaluated against five main criteria: environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, market management, revenue management and stakeholder engagement. Within each of these categories, ETS attributes - including abatement cost, stringency of the cap, improved allocation practices over time and the trajectory of price stability - are assessed for each system. Institutional learning, administrative prudence, appropriate carbon revenue management and stakeholder engagement are identified as key ingredients for successful ETS regimes. Recent implementation of ETSs in regions including California, Qu{\'e}bec and South Korea indicates significant institutional learning from prior systems, especially the EU ETS, with these regions implementing more robust administrative and regulatory structures suitable for handling unique national and sub-national opportunities and constraints. The analysis also shows that there is potential for a `double dividend' in emissions reductions even with a modest carbon price, provided the cap tightens over time and a portion of the auctioned revenues are reinvested in other emissions-reduction activities. Knowledge gaps exist in understanding the interaction of pricing instruments with other climate policy instruments and how governments manage these policies to achieve optimum emissions reductions with lower administrative costs.Key policy insights Countries are learning from each other on ETS implementation.Administrative and regulatory structures of ETS jurisdictions appear to evolve and become more robust in every ETS analysed.A `double dividend' for emissions reductions may also exist in cases where mitigation occurs as a result of the ETS policy and when auction revenues are reinvested in other emissions-reduction activities.},

  shorttitle = {Electricity Regulation in the {{Chinese}} National Emissions Trading Scheme ({{ETS}})},
  abstract = {Carbon leakage is central to the discussion on how to mitigate climate change. The current carbon leakage literature focuses largely on industrial production, and less attention has been given to carbon leakage from the electricity sector (the largest source of carbon emissions in China). Moreover, very few studies have examined in detail electricity regulation in the Chinese national emissions trading system (which leads, for example, to double counting) or addressed its implications for potential linkage between the EU and Chinese emissions trading systems (ETSs). This article seeks to fill this gap by analysing the problem of `carbon leakage' from the electricity sector under the China ETS. Specifically, a Law \& Economics approach is applied to scrutinize legal documents on electricity/carbon regulation and examine the economic incentive structures of stakeholders in the inter-/intra-regional electricity markets. Two forms of `electricity carbon leakage' are identified and further supported by legal evidence and practical cases. Moreover, the article assesses the environmental and economic implications for the EU of potential linkage between the world's two largest ETSs. In response, policy suggestions are proposed to address electricity carbon leakage, differentiating leakage according to its sources.Key policy insights Electricity carbon leakage in China remains a serious issue that has yet to receive sufficient attention.Such leakage arises from the current electricity/carbon regulatory framework in China and jeopardizes mitigation efforts.With the US retreat on climate efforts, evidence suggests that EU officials are looking to China and expect an expanded carbon market to reinforce EU global climate leadership.Given that the Chinese ETS will be twice the size of the EU ETS, a small amount of carbon leakage in China could have significant repercussions. Electricity carbon leakage should thus be considered in any future EU\textendash{}China linking negotiations.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper analyzes distributional effects the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) created between participants of the scheme during its first trading period. To this end, a dataset recording all transfers during the first period of the EU ETS, originally at account level, was enhanced by adding information about parent companies, firm characteristics, and carbon prices. A two-step selection model was formulated and applied to the data. To account for a number of uncertainties, sensitivity analysis with regard to forward and futures trading was carried out. Findings confirm that free allocation in excess of actual emissions (\guilsinglleft{}overallocation\guilsinglright{}) is a major source of gain generated under the Scheme. The fact that small companies are much less likely to participate in trading is a further cause of distributional effects. This paper also discusses that windfall profits obtained by passing through the cost of freely allocated allowances to consumers are likely to dwarf the gains and losses made on the market for EU Allowances. It is therefore quite likely that the majority of companies covered by the EU ETS generated gains during its first period, either through selling overallocation on the market or by generating windfall profits on product markets. Therefore, decisions about the level of free allocation not only have distributional implications for the participants of an emissions trading scheme but determine the distribution of costs and benefits between covered companies and households.},

  abstract = {Fear of lowering firms' competitiveness and carbon leakage is the reason for large amounts of allowances in the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) still being allocated for free. At the same time, unadjusted free allocation of allowances in times of economic recession is partly responsible for the large surplus of allowances that has cumulated in the EU ETS and that is lowering prices in the market. For Phase IV, the introduction of dynamic allocation has been proposed to react to significant changes in production, to prevent the accumulation of further surplus on the one hand and to protect installations from severe underallocation on the other. A reserve of about 400 million allowances is planned for that purpose. This paper analyses the demand for certificates from this reserve under different assumptions on production development as well as different design options for Phase IV. The analysis builds on freely available allocation data from Phase III along with projections of production trends from different time periods in the past. In most of the scenarios, the 400 million allowances are sufficient to fulfil demand for allowances from dynamic allocation until at least the second half of Phase IV (often even for the whole of Phase IV). Even though certain aspects analysed are now not fully compatible with the agreed-upon Phase IV revision, the analysis indicates that the amount of allowances foreseen for dynamic allocation is sufficient for Phase IV. In particular the threshold value of 10\% that was introduced in the legislation will ensure that the demand of allowances is likely well below the demand found in the different scenarios in this analysis that neglects this threshold value.},

  shorttitle = {Financialization Impedes Climate Change Mitigation},
  abstract = {The article investigates how financialization impedes climate change mitigation by examining its effects on the early history of one low-carbon industry, solar photovoltaics in the United States. The industry grew rapidly in the 1970s, as large financial conglomerates acquired independent firms. While providing needed financial support, conglomerates changed the focus from existing markets in consumer applications toward a future utility market that never materialized. Concentration of the industry also left it vulnerable to the corporate restructuring of the 1980s, when the conglomerates were dismantled and solar divisions were pared back or sold off to foreign firms. Both the move toward conglomeration, when corporations became managed as stock portfolios, and its subsequent reversal were the result of increased financial dominance over corporate governance. The American case is contrasted with the more successful case of Japan, where these changes to corporate governance did not occur. Insulated from shareholder pressure and financial turbulence, Japanese photovoltaics manufacturers continued to expand investment throughout the 1980s when their American rivals were cutting back. The study is informed by Joseph Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction and Hyman Minsky's theory of financialization, along with economic sociology. By highlighting the tenuous and conflicting relation between finance and production that shaped the early history of the photovoltaics industry, the article raises doubts about the prevailing approach to mitigate climate change through carbon pricing. Given the uncertainty of innovation and the ease of speculation, it will do little to spur low-carbon technology development without financial structures supporting patient capital.
