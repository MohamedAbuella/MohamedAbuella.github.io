<p>You can have a look at pdf copies of my <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Mohamed-Abuella-Resume/blob/master/Mohamed%20Abuella_Resume.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue">CV</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Mohamed-Abuella-PhD-Thesis_PDF_PPT_versions/blob/master/Mohamed%20Abuella%20Key%20Skills%20Cloud.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Key Skills & Interests Cloud</a>.</p>

<p> To sum it up in a broad sense, let's imagine that.. If my professional development was a book, its title would be..  </p> <h2>"Electric Power Systems Operation and Planning"</h2>
<p> Thus, the chapters of this book would be as follows:</p> 
<p><h3 Ch.1 </h3> Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. This chapter covers Instrumentation & Control, Basics of Power Electronics such as Diodes & Thyristors as rectifiers, (maneuvered by applying Laws of Physics). With getting hands-on electrical installation & wiring and maintenance of electrical control equipment at pumping stations.</p> 
<p><a style="color:red"> Ch.2</a> Power Systems Analysis. It includes Power Flow and Faults Calculations, (applying Numerical Analysis methods, such as Newton methods, Differential eqs & Integrals, etc). Get hands-on some simulations of power systems and programmable logic controllers (PLC).</p>
<p><a style="color:red"> Ch.3</a> Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). It is considering renewables as well, specifically for wind energy resouces at the transmission level, (applying Optimization techniques). Get hands-on more of modeling and analysis of power systems.</p>
<p><a style="color:red"> Ch.4</a> Optimize the Integration of Renewables into the Grid. Solar Power Modeling and Forecasting, (applying Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics, AI and ML techniques). Get hands-on data-driven analytics and become more familiar with conducting & publishing research.</p>
<p><a style="color:red"> Ch.5</a> Who knows!</p>
