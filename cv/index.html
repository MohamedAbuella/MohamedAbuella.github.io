<p>Take a look at a pdf copy of my <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Mohamed-Abuella-Resume/blob/master/Mohamed%20Abuella_Resume.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue">CV</a>

<p> To sum it up, let's imagine that.. If I were a book, its title would be...  </p> <h1>"Electric Power Systems Operation and Planning"</h1>
<p> And the chapters of this book would be as follows:</p> 
<p>Ch.1: Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. This chapter covers Instrumentation & Control, Power Electronics, such as Diodes & Thyristors as rectifiers, (applying laws of Physics). With getting hands-on electrical installations & wiring and maintenance of electrical control equipment at pumping stations.</p> 
<p>Ch.2: Power Systems Analysis. It includes Power Flow and Faults Calculations, (applying Numerical Analysis methods, such as Newton methods, Differential eqs & Integrals, etc). Get hands-on some simulations of power systems and programmable logic controllers (PLC).</p>
<p>Ch.3: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). It is considering renewables as well, specifically for wind energy resouces at the transmission level, (applying Optimization techniques). Get hands-on more of modeling and analysis of power systems.</p>
<p>Ch.4: Optimize the Integration of Renewables into the Grid. Solar Power Modeling and Forecasting (applying Statistical, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics, AI and ML techniques). Get hands-on data-driven analytics.</p>
<p>Ch.5: Who knows!</p>
