<p>Take a look at a pdf copy of my <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Mohamed-Abuella-Resume/blob/master/Mohamed%20Abuella_Resume.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue">CV</a>

<p> But, now let's imagine that... If I were a book, its title would be... </p> <h1>"Electrical Power Systems Operation and Planning"</h1>
<p> And the chapters of this book as follows:</p> 
<p>Ch.1: Electrical Engineering Fundamentals, (Control & Instrumentation, Power Electronics such as Diodes & Thyristors, especially rectifiers with inductive loads). With getting hands-on electrical installations & wiring and maintenance of electrical control equipment at pumping stations.</p> 
<p>Ch.2: Power Systems Analysis, especially Power Flow, (Numerical Analysis methods, Newton, Differential, Integrals, etc). Get hands-on programmable logic controllers and some simulation of power systems.</p>
<p>Ch.3: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) with focus on including renewables, specifically for wind energy resouces at the transmission level, (Optimization techniques). Get hands-on more of modeling and analysis of power systems.</p>
<p>Ch.4: Optimize the Integration of Renewables into the Grid,  (Statistical, Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics, AI and ML techniques). Get hands-on data-driven analytics.</p>
<p>Ch.5: Who knows!</p>
