<p>  If I were a book, its title would be... </p> <h1>"Electrical Power Systems Operation and Planning"</h1>
<p>Ch1: Electrical Engineering Fundamentals, (Control & Instrumentation, Power Electronics such as Diodes, Thyristors, especially rectifying circuits with inductive loads). With getting hands-on electrical installations & wiring and maintenance of electrical control equipment at pumping stations.</p> 
<p>Ch2: Power Systems analysis, especially Power Flow, (numerical analysis methods, Newton, differential, integrals, etc). Get hands-on programmable logic controllers and some simulation of power systems.</p>
<p>Ch3: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) with focus on including renewables, specifically for wind energy resouces at the transmission level (Optimization techniques). Get hands-on more of modeling and analysis of power systems.</p>
<p>Ch4: Optimize the Integration of Renewables into the Grid,  (statistical, predictive and prescriptive analytics, AI and ML techniques). Get hands-on data-driven analytics.</p>
