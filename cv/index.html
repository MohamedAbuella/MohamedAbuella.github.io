<h1>If I were a book, its title would be "Electrical Power Systems Operation and Planning"</h1>
Ch1: Electrical Eng fundamentals, (control & instrumentation, Diodes, Thyristor, especially rectifying circuits with inductive loads). With get hands-on electrical installations & wiring and maintenance of electrical control equipment.
Ch2: Power systems analysis, especially Power Flow (numerical analysis methods, newton, differential, integration etc) with hands-on programmable logic controllers and simulation of power systems.
Ch3: OPF or SCED with focus oof inclding renewables, specifically for wind resouces at the transmission level (Optimization Techniques). Get hands-on modeling and analysis of power systems.
Ch4: Optimize the integration of renewables into the grid,  (statistical, predictive and perspective analytics, AI, and ML techniques). Get hands-on data-driven analytics.</p>
