  abstract = {We use indices from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative to investigate the impact of climate vulnerability on bond yields. Our methodology invokes panel ordinary least squares with robust standard errors and principal component analysis. The latter serves to address the multicollinearity between a set of vulnerability measures. We find that countries with higher exposure to climate vulnerability, such as the member countries of the V20 climate vulnerable forum, exhibit 1.174 percent higher cost of debt on average. This effect is significant after accounting for a set of macroeconomic controls. Specifically, we estimate the incremental debt cost due to higher climate vulnerability, for the V20 countries, to have exceeded USD 62 billion over the last ten years. In other words, for every ten dollars they pay in interest cost, they pay another dollar for being climate vulnerable. We also find that a measure of social readiness, which includes education and infrastructure, has a negative and significant effect on bond yields, implying that social and physical investments can mitigate climate risk related debt costs and help to stabilize the cost of debt for vulnerable countries.},

Furthermore, central banks, through their regulatory oversight over money, credit, and the financial system, are in a powerful position to support the development of green finance models and enforce an adequate pricing of environmental and carbon risk by financial institutions. The central topic of this paperare the public financial governance policies through which central banks, as well as other relevant financial regulatory agencies, can address environmental risk and promote sustainable finance. The paperfirst discusses the reasons why central banks should be concerned with aligning finance with sustainable development. Second, the paperreviews the tools and instruments that can be utilized by central banks and financial regulatory agencies to address environmental risk and promote green finance and sustainable development. Third, the paperprovides a brief review of green public financial governance initiatives.},

Various certification mechanisms have evolved to allow more granularity as well as continuity in assessment. Green bonds have been priced at issuance at a premium on average relative to conventional bonds, but their performance in the secondary market over time has been similar. A relatively large share of green bonds are in sectors subject to environmentally related credit risks. More consistent green bond standards across jurisdictions could help to further develop the market.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty is intrinsic to climate change: we know that the climate is changing, but not precisely how fast or in what ways. Nor do we understand fully the social and economic consequences of these changes, or the options that will be available for reducing climate change. Furthermore the uncertainty about these issues is not readily quantified and expressed in probabilistic terms: we are facing deep uncertainty or ambiguity rather than risk in the classical sense, rendering the classical expected utility framework of limited value. We review the sources of uncertainty about all aspects of climate change and resolve these into various components, commenting on their relative importance. Then we review decision-making frameworks that are appropriate in the absence of quantitative probabilistic information, including non-probabilistic approaches and those based on multiple priors, and discuss their application in climate change economics.},

  abstract = {One of the most striking things about forecasters is their lack of historical perspective. They rarely do retrospectives, even though looking back at past work can both illuminate the reasons for its success or failure, and improve the methodologies of current and future forecasts. One of the best and most famous retrospectives is that by Hans Landsberg, which investigates work conducted by Landsberg, Sam Schurr, and others. In this article, written mainly for model users, we highlight Landsberg's retrospective as a uniquely valuable contribution to improving forecasting methodologies. We also encourage model users to support such retrospectives more frequently. Finally, we give the current generation of analysts the kind of guidance we believe Landsberg and Sam Schurr would have offered about how to do retrospectives well.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical discourse linking traditional market failure literature and the recent research around potential stranded assets risks associated with the transition to a lowcarbon economy (defined here as `transition risks'). While it does not seek to prove a mispricing in practical terms, it demonstrates the extent to which the market failure literature provides theoretical evidence of a potential mispricing of these risks, as a result of the design and interpretation of financial risk models, and the practices and institutions linked to economic agents. The evidence supports a growing body of practical literature highlighting transition risks in financial markets. It suggests that there may be a case for policy intervention to address the market failures and associated potential mispricing of risk. It also suggests however that this intervention will likely need to address both the design of financial risk models and associated transparency around their results, and the actual institutions governing risk management. A key challenge in this regard involves resolving the principal\textendash{}agent problem in financial markets and the associated `tragedy of the horizons'.},

This report presents an analysis of the development and functioning of the green bond market, including the main actors and sectors, with specific focus on financing invest-ments into improved resource efficiency. It summarizes the key bottlenecks limiting the development of the market in specific countries and sectors. It identifies a set of possible public sector measures to overcome these bottlenecks, supported by exam-ples of good practices. The report also assesses the regulatory feasibility and expected impacts of specific standardization options on the liquidity and size of the market. Finally, the report presents a set of recommendations addressed at the EU and its Member States. A Policy Toolbox provides additional detail on possible public sector measures on the demand and supply side. Nine country case studies support the analysis, focusing on Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, as well as China, Mexico, Nor-way, and the United States.},

  abstract = {With the urgency of climate change, and billions spent globally on renewable energy (RE) support policies, it is crucial to understand which policies are effective. Substantial scholarly research on RE deployment policies has been carried out over the last two decades, resulting in inconclusive findings regarding the effectiveness of mobilizing private finance. Here, we take a novel perspective and review 96 empirical studies concerning the impact of policies on two key investor decision metrics: investment risk and investment return. Only if both metrics correspond to the investors' expectations are they willing to engage in RE projects. First, our rigorous literature review shows that effective policies address risk and return simultaneously. Second, we find that generic instrument design features, such as credibility and predictability (continuous evaluation and monitoring), considerably impact investment risk. A more focused analysis of the specific design elements of feed-in tariffs, auctions and renewable portfolio standards reveals that these instruments are most effective when they are designed in such a way that they reduce RE project risk while increasing return. We distil important implications for policymakers who aim to foster renewable energy and clean technologies more broadly.},

  title = {Physical Climate Risk: {{Investor}} Needs and Information Gaps},
  shorttitle = {Physical Climate Risk},
  abstract = {While investors are paying more attention to climate change, there is a lack of granular data designed to support financial decisions. Climate science can provide improved indicators and metrics to help investors better manage physical climate risks. This report presents the first results of the ERA4CS-JPI Climate project ClimINVEST aimed at co-designing tailored information on climate change. We provide an overview of investors' needs and information gaps regarding the physical impacts of climate change. We identify the information sources that financial actors rely on and the challenges they face in decision-making incorporating available climate change information while taking into account diverse investor mandates and risk management approaches. The user needs identified underscore the need for collaborative efforts between researchers and the financial sector on improving climate risk information.  
 
The report presents three geographical case studies \textendash{} France, the Netherlands and Norway. These countries are at the forefront of creating awareness and acting on the risks and opportunities of the physical impacts of climate change in the financial sector. The cases provide unique perspectives on the country-specific contexts and initiatives related to physical climate risk and user needs, featuring both commonalities and differences.  
 
In France, the 2015's Energy Transition for Green Growth Act (Article 173-VI) requires institutional investors to report on their integration of climate-related risks in their investment policies. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Central Bank and financial institutions are challenged to deal with potential flood risks from more frequent precipitation and sea level rise. In Norway, actors such as Finance Norway and the Norwegian government are assessing the risks from physical impacts of climate change on the Norwegian economy},

  abstract = {A clean energy revolution in sub-Saharan Africa is urgently needed to win the fight against energy poverty, to promote robust development and to make it more sustainable. Clean energy can unlock sustainable economic growth, improve human health and well-being and enable women and children to lead more productive lives. It will also raise human security and build resilience in nation states and communities. This report takes an in-depth look at the challenges and opportunities to provide clean energy access in sub-Saharan Africa. Packages of policies are needed to promote clean energy access, including electricity for productive uses and a full range of technical solutions \textendash{} notably off-grid and mini-grid renewables, energy efficiency \textendash{} as well as clean cooking. Innovative financing and improved public sector governance are essential ingredients to make markets work. Delivering on this golden opportunity for development requires not just more money but policy attention and massive political effort from both domestic and international actors.},
