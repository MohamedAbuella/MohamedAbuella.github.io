<p> Just wondering if the education of renewable energy technologies at college has the same momentum as theirs does in industry!
<br> In other words, does the college curriculum catch up to the advancements in energy technologies?

<br> Technology is in progress, just for example, newspapers and TV have been dying slowly over time and replaced by digital circulation and media, “at least, it happens among younger viewers.”
<p> Thus, for this generation and next who at schools, it is time to increase the momentum of teaching and learning for renewable energy technologies which are replacing the traditional fossil-fuel technologies in many parts of the real world.
