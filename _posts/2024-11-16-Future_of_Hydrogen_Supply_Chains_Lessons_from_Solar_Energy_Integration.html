<p>On May 22, 2024, during a travel layover from Sweden to England to sart in a research project for hydrogen integration for accelerated energy transitions (Hi-ACT), I stumbled upon an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> at the airport lodge. The article, titled <i>Lex in Depth: How the Hydrogen Hype Fizzled Out</i>, inspired me to reflect on the challenges facing hydrogen today. Coincidentally, it reminded me of Varun Sivaram’s <i>Taming the Sun: Innovations to Harness Solar Energy and Power the Planet</i>, a book I read in 2019 after completing my PhD. Sivaram’s framework for overcoming solar energy hurdles holds valuable insights for hydrogen integration.</p>

<p>Below, I explore a similar framework adapted for building resilient and innovative hydrogen supply chains to accelerate the energy transition:</p>

<p><strong>Lessons from Solar Energy</strong></p>

<p>Sivaram’s framework highlights that systemic, technological, and financial innovations must evolve simultaneously. This holistic approach led to breakthroughs in solar deployment and is equally vital for hydrogen. By addressing these dimensions, hydrogen can transition from niche applications to mainstream energy solutions, supporting the global move toward a low-carbon future.</p>

<p>This presentation builds on these ideas to outline an actionable roadmap for hydrogen integration. Explore the full presentation <a href="file:///C:/Users/Mhdella/Downloads/Hyd_Vision.pdf">here</a>.</p>
