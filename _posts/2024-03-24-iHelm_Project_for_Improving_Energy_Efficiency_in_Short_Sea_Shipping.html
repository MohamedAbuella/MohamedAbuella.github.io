<p><em>This iHelm project is a collaboration between the Center of Applied Intelligent Systems Research (CAISR) at Halmstad University and industry partner, CetaSol AB, in Gothenburg, Sweden.</em></p>
<p> To meet the urgent requirements for the climate change mitigation, several proactive measures of energy efficiency have been implemented in maritime industry. Many of these practices depend highly on the onboard data of vessel's operation and environmental conditions.
<br> In this project, high resolution onboard data have been collected by our industry partner from two passenger vessels in Archipelago of Gothenburg and Baltic Sea, Sweden, to improve vessels energy efficiency in short-sea shipping (SSS).
<p>The summary report for summarizing the major methods and key findings of this project is available here <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Data_Analytics_for_Improving_Energy_Efficiency_in_Short_Sea_Shipping/blob/main/iHelm_Project_Report_v1.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue"> PDF file </a> </p>
<p>The complete technical report is available here <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Data_Analytics_for_Improving_Energy_Efficiency_in_Short_Sea_Shipping/blob/main/iHelm_Project_Report_IEEEclass_Project_v1.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue"> PDF file </a> </p> 
<p> Additionally, we have developed several tools and models to aid in our analysis and optimization efforts:</p>
