<p>
This interactive policy sensitivity navigator explores how carbon constraints and Contract-for-Difference (CfD) support mechanisms influence hydrogen deployment in the Great Britain (GB) power system by 2050. Developed as part of the <strong>HI-ACT project</strong> on accelerated energy transition, the tool enables dynamic assessment of hydrogen integration pathways under varying policy and economic conditions.
</p>

<p>
The navigator allows users to examine a wide range of <strong>CO₂ emission limits</strong> (0–500) and <strong>CfD support levels</strong> (0–250), and to assess their combined impact on system costs, emissions, and investment outcomes. Multiple hydrogen supply routes—including <em>Grey H₂</em>, <em>Blue H₂</em>, and <em>Green H₂</em>—can be interactively enabled or disabled to reflect alternative decarbonization strategies.
</p>

<p>
Users can further explore the sensitivity of results across <strong>high and low investment assumptions</strong> and <strong>feedstock price scenarios</strong>, making the tool particularly useful for policy stress-testing and comparative analysis.
</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Interactive exploration of CO₂ emission caps and CfD support levels</li>
  <li>Toggleable hydrogen production pathways (Grey, Blue, and Green H₂)</li>
  <li>High/low investment and feedstock price sensitivity analysis</li>
  <li>Multiple performance metrics, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Total system emissions</li>
      <li>Green hydrogen penetration</li>
      <li>Marginal and average system costs</li>
      <li>Net Present Value (NPV)</li>
      <li>Marginal abatement cost</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Heatmap-based visualizations and policy navigators for intuitive comparison</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy Insights</h2>

<p>
By combining carbon constraints with targeted financial support mechanisms, the navigator highlights trade-offs between cost efficiency and decarbonization ambition. It enables policymakers, system planners, and researchers to identify policy combinations that deliver meaningful emissions reductions while maintaining economic viability.
</p>

<p>
The tool is particularly useful for evaluating <strong>combined policy scores</strong>, offering a structured way to compare competing policy packages and understand how hydrogen technologies respond to evolving regulatory environments.
</p>
