<p>The Levelized Cost of Thermal Energy (LCOT) Calculator is an interactive tool developed to support techno-economic analysis of various heating technologies. This tool allows users to input system and economic parameters and dynamically evaluates the LCOT for different heating systems including natural gas boilers, electric resistance heaters, air-source heat pumps, and solar thermal systems.</p>

<p>The calculator is designed to help policymakers, researchers, and engineers better understand how changes in capital cost, efficiency, fuel price, lifetime, or discount rate affect the competitiveness of thermal energy systems over their lifetime.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive and Dynamic</strong>: The tool updates LCOT results in real-time as users adjust input parameters, providing instant feedback on how each factor influences cost outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology Comparisons</strong>: Users can compare the LCOT of multiple heating technologies side-by-side to assess their relative economic viability under different conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Standalone HTML File</strong>: The calculator is a self-contained HTML file, which means it can be run directly in any modern web browser without the need for additional software or dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency and Customization</strong>: The tool makes all assumptions and formulas visible and customizable, enhancing its educational and decision-support value.</li>
</ul>
