<p>This project focuses on decarbonizing residential heating systems in the North of Tyne (NoT) region through the integration of social interventions and low-carbon technologies. The research assesses both the direct impact of social interventions on energy consumption and CO₂ emissions, and the technical feasibility of deploying heat pumps, hydrogen boilers, and hydrogen blending as alternative heating solutions.</p>

<p>The study addresses critical questions related to emissions, system performance, and the economic dispatching of resources under varying scenarios of social and technical intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Social Intervention Scenarios</strong>: Various scenarios were modeled to assess how social interventions can impact energy demand, particularly focusing on the coldest days in November 2019. These interventions showed a significant decrease in gas demand with a minimal impact on electricity demand.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Monte Carlo Simulations</strong>: Using Monte Carlo methods, the study quantified the effects of combined social and technical interventions on gas and electricity demands. The results indicate notable reductions in gas demand, while electricity demand saw a marginal increase due to heat pump deployment.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Long-Term Economic Planning</strong>: For the period between 2025 and 2050, the study conducted economic planning simulations, with specific consideration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) deployment starting in 2040. The study also explored hydrogen blending's role at different integration levels in the gas network, suggesting that hydrogen integration alongside CCS technology could play a crucial role in NoT’s heating decarbonization efforts.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Heat Pump and Hydrogen Boiler Interventions</strong>: The results reveal that scaling up heat pump and hydrogen boiler use in residential areas could further reduce emissions and support the NoT region's decarbonization targets.</p></li>
