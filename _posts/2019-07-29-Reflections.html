<p><cite>Energy and Civilization: A History</cite> by Vaclav Smil. Published by the MIT Press (May 12, 2017).</p>
<p>For quite a long period of time, I've been emerging in a pool of elaborate technical stuff related to energy systems, 
but a thoughtful reading of this book helped me of overviewing and seeing the topic from a broad perspective, and enjoy the relaxing 
info it provides!</p>
<p>The book is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Civilization-History-MIT-Press/dp/0262035774" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Amazon </a> </p>
