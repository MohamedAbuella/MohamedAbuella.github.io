<p>For quite a long period of time, I've been emerging in a pool of elaborate technical stuff related to energy systems, 
but a thoughtful reading of this book helped me of overviewing and seeing the topic from a broad perspective, and enjoy the relaxing 
info it provides!</p>
<p>The book can be found on amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Civilization-History-MIT-Press/dp/0262035774" target="_blank">Amazon Link </a> </p>
