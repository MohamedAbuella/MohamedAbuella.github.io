<h3> iHelm Porjec: Data Analytics for Improving Energy Efficiency in Short Sea Shipping </h3>
<p> To meet the urgent requirements for the climate change mitigation, several proactive measures of energy efficiency have been implemented in maritime industry. Many of these practices depend highly on the onboard data of vessel's operation and environmental conditions.</a>
<p> In this project, a high resolution onboard data from passenger vessels in short-sea shipping (SSS) have been collected and preprocessed.</a></p>
<p>The Summary Report of iHelm Porject is available here <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Data_Analytics_for_Improving_Energy_Efficiency_in_Short_Sea_Shipping/blob/main/iHelm_Project_Report_v1.pdf"_blank" style="color:blue"> Technical Report PDF file </a> </p>
