<p> To meet the urgent requirements for the climate change mitigation, several proactive measures of energy efficiency have been implemented in maritime industry. Many of these practices depend highly on the onboard data of vessel's operation and environmental conditions.
<br> In this project, a high resolution onboard data have been collected by our industry partner, CetaSol AB, from two passenger vessels in Archipelago of Gothenburg and Baltic Sea, Sweden.
<p>The technical report summarizing the major methods and key findings of this project is available here <a href="https://github.com/MohamedAbuella/Data_Analytics_for_Improving_Energy_Efficiency_in_Short_Sea_Shipping/blob/main/iHelm_Project_Report_v1.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:blue"> PDF file </a> </p>
