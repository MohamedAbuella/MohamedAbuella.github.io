<p>The hydrogen blending study is a collaborative effort focused on assessing the potential of hydrogen as a component in the North of Tyne's gas network to enhance sustainability. Researchers utilized advanced modeling techniques, such as game theory, combined with OPGF models to investigate both short-term operations and long-term investments for hydrogen blending in energy systems.</p>

<p>This project particularly examines hydrogen's role in stabilizing energy supply, targeting decarbonization goals, and its viability for supporting renewable energy integration in this region.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Game-Theoretic Model Integration</strong>: The project combines a game-theoretic (GT) approach with an OPGF model to simulate realistic energy scenarios, focusing on balancing hydrogen integration within existing gas networks.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Techno-Economic Analysis</strong>: Using data specific to the North of Tyne region, the project performs a detailed techno-economic analysis, revealing the potential benefits of hydrogen blending, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness and emissions reduction.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Results</strong>: Simulation results suggest that hydrogen blending can stabilize energy output while reducing CO₂ emissions. The analysis highlights that blending hydrogen into the gas network could contribute significantly to the region’s decarbonization targets.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Investment Planning</strong>: Long-term simulations outline investment needs and priorities for the region, enabling policymakers to plan for infrastructure and technology improvements in line with regional energy and climate goals.</p></li>
