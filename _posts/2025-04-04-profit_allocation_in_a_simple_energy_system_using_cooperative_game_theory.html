<p>This project applies Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) to a simple energy system, focusing on profit allocation among four different energy generation players: Nuclear, Wind, PV, and Gas-CCS. The simulation evaluates how these players can cooperate to generate energy and distribute the resulting profits fairly. Several allocation methods, including the Shapley value, Nucleolus (n=4 heuristic), and Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), are explored to achieve stable and efficient profit distribution.</p>

<p>The study delves into the key principles of CGT, emphasizing efficiency, rationality, and stability within the energy system. The results provide valuable insights into how profit sharing can be optimized in a collaborative environment while maintaining fairness and ensuring all parties are incentivized to cooperate.</p>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Characteristic Function</strong>: The value of different coalitions (combinations of energy generators) was calculated, demonstrating how cooperative efforts increase overall profits. For example, the profit generated by the coalition of Nuclear and Wind generators was £2,175,342.47, highlighting the benefits of strategic collaboration.</li>
    <li><strong>Shapley Value Allocation</strong>: The Shapley value method was applied to allocate the total profits (£2,947,512.80) among the four players. The allocation was fair, with each player receiving a portion proportional to their marginal contributions. The individual allocations were as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Player 1 (Nuclear): £886,986.30</li>
            <li>Player 2 (Wind): £1,288,356.16</li>
            <li>Player 3 (PV): £407,534.25</li>
            <li>Player 4 (Gas-CCS): £364,636.09</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nucleolus (n=4 Heuristic)</strong>: Using a heuristic method for the Nucleolus, the allocation was found to be identical to that of the Shapley value, indicating that the game was already in a balanced state. The Nucleolus method seeks to minimize dissatisfaction among coalitions by reducing the excesses (the differences between allocated and expected profits), and in this case, it did so without changing the Shapley allocation.</li>
    <li><strong>Nash Bargaining Solution</strong>: Similarly, the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) resulted in the same allocation as the Shapley value, suggesting that under the given conditions, these three methods of profit distribution lead to the same optimal result. The NBS allocation focuses on maximizing the product of individual utilities, ensuring all players are better off than if they had acted alone.</li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Cooperative Game Theory in solving real-world energy system problems. By applying methods like the Shapley value, Nucleolus, and Nash Bargaining Solution, we can ensure that profits from energy generation are distributed in a way that is both efficient and fair. This approach not only enhances collaboration among energy players but also provides valuable insights into how future energy systems could be optimized for profit sharing.</p>
