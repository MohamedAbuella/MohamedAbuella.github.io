<p> The electric load of the microgrid is mixed with distributed generations, such as wind turbines and PV systems. The system operation management at the microgrid is more challenging that it is at the bulk power system. Therefore, short-term ahead forecasts could mitigate some operation and economic issues [1]. The net load at the terminal of the main grid is determined by subtracting the aggregated power supply of the distributed generations from the aggregated demand of the consumers in the microgrid [2], [3].</p>
