<p> Mohamed Abuellaâ€™s Background and Skills with Tools for Power System Design and Analysis

Studying power systems needs tools for design, analysis, modeling & simulation these systems, including software tools and Real-time digital simulators, and test work bench/bed. If my professional development was a book, its title would be "Energy Systems Modeling and Analysis: Operation, Planning, and Integration."

[Undergraduate Studies]

- Matlab scripts in a floppy disk in 2006: Calculation, solving, and validation exercises in PSA textbook by Hadi Saadat. Utilizing user-defined functions for Ybus matrix, Newton Raphson, Gauss Seidel, fast decoupling, symmetrical components I0,1,2, Zbus, etc.
- PowerWorld (simulation software) in Power courses for OPF and faults calculations, as per the PSA textbook by Glover and Sarma.
- NEPLAN and Matlab: Used for B. Tech. Graduation Project of OPF and short-circuit/faults calculations in levels of Transmission & Distribution.

[Postgraduate Studies]

[**MSc**]

- Matlab Simulink: Design power systems, operation and control (design and test power electronics, batteries, PV, wind turbines, compensation, and power factor, etc.).
- Power systems analysis using GUI to build a tool for power flow and short-circuit calculation with IEEE 11, 14, 30Bus test systems, including map visualization.
- Power flow and stability analysis with Power Systems Analysis Toolbox (PSAT), an open-source and user-friendly tool developed by Federico Milano.
- MS thesis for wind ops using MATPOWER, an open-source package for power system simulation and optimization developed by Ray Zimmerman.

[**PhD and Lecturer at CIT**]

- ETAP lab for distribution systems: Design feeders, maintain voltage profile, compensation, calculation forward/backward Sweep based power flow, and short-circuit/fault currents at multiple locations.
- SPICE (open-source) and PSCAD simulation software tools used for power electronic circuit design and power quality.
- Teaching energy systems modeling & analysis (especially for renewables and storage systems) involving tools built by Python (Jupyter notebook for code, text & graphs), such as PyPSA, Pandapower, Calliope, Pyomo (for optimal allocation of resources). Calliope: a multi-scale energy systems modeling framework based on Python.
- Interested in interactive teaching including animation using widgets and design dashboards with sliding switches in Jupyter notebooks, Tangle, JavaScript.

[**Postdoc with Center of Applied Intelligent Systems Research at Halmstad University**]

- Applying artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially explainable AI (XAI), to model and analyze energy systems for improving energy efficiency in short-sea shipping.
