<h1 class="custom-h1"> Mohamed Abuellaâ€™s Background and Skills with Tools for Energy Systems Modeling and Analysis </h1>

<p>Studying power systems requires tools for design, analysis, modeling & simulation of these systems, including software tools and Real-time digital simulators, and test workbench/bed. Since, if my professional development was a book, its title would be "Energy Systems Modeling and Analysis: Operation, Planning, and Integration."</p>

<p>I have studied power systems and taught them extensively since 2006. (About 25 related courses. Some courses are repeated several times, other courses are related to numerical analysis, linear algebra, optimization topics which have a key role in understanding the power systems).</p>

<h2>Undergraduate</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Matlab scripts on a floppy disk in 2006: Calculation and solving exercises in PSA textbook by Hadi Saadat (Ybus matrix, Newton Raphson, Gauss Seidel, fast decoupling, symmetrical components I0,1,2, Zbus, etc., utilizing user-defined functions).</li>
    <li>PowerWorld (simulation software) in Power courses for OPF and faults calculations, in PSA textbook by Glover and Sarma.</li>
    <li>NEPLAN and Matlab: For B. Tech. Graduation Project of OPF and short-circuit/faults calculations in levels of Transmission & Distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Postgraduate</h2>

<h3>MSc</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Matlab Simulink: Design power systems, operation and control (design and test power electronics, batteries, PV, wind turbines, compensation and power factor, etc.).</li>
    <li>In Power systems analysis, using GUI to build a tool for power flow and short-circuit calculation with IEEE 11, 14, 30Bus test systems. Including map visualization.</li>
    <li>Power flow and stability analysis Power Systems Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) open-source and user-friendly tool for Power systems analysis and dynamic studies (steady-state/transient analysis). Developer: Federico Milano, from the University of Castilla in Spain, now at University College Dublin (UCD).</li>
    <li>In MS thesis for wind ops, MATPOWER operates directly on the bus-branch model of the grid. MATPOWER is an open-source package for power system simulation and optimization developed by Ray Zimmerman at Cornell University.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PhD and Lecturer at CIT</h3>
<ul>
    <li>ETAP lab for distribution systems: Design feeders, maintain voltage profile, compensation, calculation forward/backward Sweep based power flow, and short-circuit/fault currents at multiple locations.</li>
    <li>SPICE (open-source) and PSCAD simulation software tools used for power electronic circuit design and power quality.</li>
    <li>In teaching energy systems modeling & analysis (especially for renewables and storage systems) involving tools built by Python (Jupyter notebook for code, text & graphs), such as PyPSA, Pandapower, Calliope, Pyomo (for optimal allocation of resources). Calliope: a multi-scale energy systems modeling framework based on Python.</li>
    <li>Also get interested in interactive teaching including animation using widgets and design dashboards with sliding switches in Jupyter notebooks, Tangle, JavaScript. (Inventing on Principle by Bret Victor, a developer and designer from Apple).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Postdoc with Center of Applied Intelligent Systems Research at Halmstad University</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Applying artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially explainable AI (XAI), to model and analyze energy systems for improving the energy efficiency in short-sea shipping.</li>
</ul>
