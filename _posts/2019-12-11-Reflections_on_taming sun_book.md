<h3>Reflection:</h3>
<p> For more deployment of solar energy we need three kinds of innovation:
1) Financial, 2) Technological, 3) Systemic innovations.</p>

<p> Financial innovations to facilitate the economic models and incentives to make the solar energy an optimal economic option.
<br>Technological innovations are needed to reduce the cost of all involved components of the solar energy system, and provide suitable equipment and trained personnel for more efficient installations.
  
<br>Systematic innovations to tackle the operational challenges that are introduced by a significant integration of solar energy resources into the power grid, and come up with innovations to maintain (or even improve) the reliability and stability of the grid.
<br>Typically, all of these innovations should continuously help the solar energy and increase its value further in the future.</p>
