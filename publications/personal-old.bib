  abstract = {This presentation focuses on recent advancements in the assessment of sectoral energy flows in the EU using input-output analysis and ecological network analysis, and focuses on the current and planned data-collection policies on regional and national level that enable future progress in this direction. More specifically, the presentation first elaborates on the methodological compatibility of ecological models and energy input-output models and recent progress made in combining these methods, and focuses specifically on critical methodological issues evolving from whether the analysis is carried out from a monetary or physical perspective. Recent insights in the compatibility of these (Majeau-Bettez, 2016; T\"obben, 2017) are discussed in the context of energy flow assessment. Based on this methodological assessment, data needs and data availability are discussed and are linked with ongoing efforts in statistical institutes on different institutional levels, such as the recent evolutions in the development of physical energy flow accounts (PEFA) on European level (Vandille, 2015; Rachermacher, 2015). The paper contributes to the debate on critical issues in carrying out monetary and physical input-output assessment for energy flows, recent advancements in ecological network analysis applied to input-output tables and links these debates with current institutional efforts and policies on national and regional level.},

  abstract = {UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps) are forming a network of 140 territories all over the globe
(GGN), that are located in various geographical settings that may be partly or entirely exposed to
various natural hazards and extreme weather events. In recent years, natural hazards have already
caused extensive damage to several UGGps. In addition, climate change seems to affect both
occurrence and intensity of various hydro-meteorological hazards. In order to have a better
understanding of the exposure of UGGps to natural hazards, and their activities to mitigate risks
the GGN and UNESCO's Section on Earth Sciences and Geo-Hazards Risk Reduction team
undertook in 2015 a thematic survey. Analyses of the data revealed the high risk that UGGps are
facing, the important role of training and awareness raising actions, as well as of the existence
and implementation of adequate risk management plans. Many UGGps in Asia and Europe have
already set as top priority the reduction of naturally induced disasters and the protection of
citizens and infrastructure, having implemented certain projects and developed concrete
infrastructure and activities to raise awareness and mitigate risks. Existing knowledge of
indigenous communities help UGGps to develop practices and initiatives to overpass crises and
become more resilient. Hereby we present thus the results of the UNESCO and GGN survey in
UGGps, as well as examples and good practices developed so far among the various geoparks.},
